.In magic, man has to rely on himself
[#magic,money,superpower]
[quote, J.K. Rowling, An interview about "Harry Potter" books]
____
In magic man has to rely on himself so in religion of course you're looking for outside support.
That's the perennial (everlasting, perpetual, annual) appeal of magic, the idea that we ourselves
have power and we can shape our world.

I sometimes think it's very analogous to having a lot of money,
that people think because that's kind of like a superpower.
I've often thought this since all this happened to me,
people think that well, you can solve anything now.
Yeah, really? It doesn't work like that! ...

.Not have lived at all
[#cautiousness]
[quote, J.K. Rowling, An interview about "Harry Potter" books]
____
It is impossible to live without failing at something unless you
live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all.
____


.If you are constantly in the state of satisfaction and happiness
[#happiness]
[quote, Jordan Peterson, MOST EPIC SPEECH - (Video Edit)]
____
Some people will tell you that purpose of the life is to be
happy. Happiness is something that is *done in* by the first harsh
blow that reality deals you.

There are many circumstances in life where
happiness is not only the wrong response, but also where the expectation of
happiness as a response will put you absolutely the wrong psychological state to
be prepared for what must be done.

People are built, so to speak, to experience
a very wide range of motivational and emotional states. So, there is a time to
be compassionate, and there is a time to be aggressive, and there is a time to be
in pain, and there's a time go be anxious, and there's a time to be joyous, and
the time to be satisfied. The healthy and well adopted person has a very wide
range of finally differentiated responses which cannot be boiled down to a
single dimension, say _happiness_ vs _unhappiness_.

Life is not that simple, life is
complex and tragic and difficult. The problem with the public portrayal of the
ideal state of human as the happiness is that it makes all of these people feel
ashamed of their own suffering. They feel that if they are suffering and if they
find their life tragic in its essence than that means that there is something wrong
with them. And instantly that makes it impossible for them to communicate
anything real about their own tragedy.

If you are constantly in the state of
satisfaction and happiness then nothing is going to affect you deeply enough.
So that you'll become deep, and life without depth is by definition shallow and
meaningless, because what it does is broaden and deepen your life in a manner
that you might compare to the difference between elevator music and a
Beethoven symphony. It's not that the symphony is in any sense happier than the
*muzak*, in fact quite a contrary, but it's deeper and more profound, and richer,
and incorporates more, and justifies itself more.

And that's the right metaphor
for life, not happiness, but depth and differentiated quality, profundity to
match the profundity and the necessity of suffering.
